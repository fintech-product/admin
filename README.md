## Business Features

- User management
- Role management

## Other Features

- Authentication
  - Log in by LDAP
  - After logged in, get all privileges based on roles of that user
- Authorization: Separate the "read" and "write" permissions for 1 role, using bitwise. For example:
  - 001 (1 in decimal) is "read" permission
  - 010 (2 in decimal) is "write" permission
  - 100 (4 in decimal) is "delete" permission
  - "read" and "write" permission will be "001 | 010 = 011" (011 is 3 in decimal)
